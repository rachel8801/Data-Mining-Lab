# Data-Cleaning and Visualization-Lab
In this lab, I am working on a real-world dataset, from NYPD containing data on calls to the New York Police Department. Information about the datasets can be found https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/
## This lab is very helpful to learn:
 - how to split the large data,
 - familiar with exploratory data analysis(EDA) process, 
 - know how to use **seaborn**, **matplotlib plot** and **heatmap** for data visualization.
## Runing Environment
- Python 3 and above
- Jupyter Notebook
