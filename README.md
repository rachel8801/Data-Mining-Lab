# Data-Cleaning and Visualization-Lab
- In this lab, I am working on a real-world dataset, from NYPD containing data on calls to the New York Police Department.
- This lab is very helpful to learn how to split the large data,familiar with exploratory data analysis(EDA) process, and know how to use seaborn plot, matplotlib plot and heatmap for data visualization.
