# Data Mining labs
This lab contains a series of basic pratical exercises. 
## Data-Cleaning and Visualization-Lab
This lab is working on a real-world dataset, from NYPD containing data on calls to the New York Police Department. Information about the datasets can be found https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/
## This lab is very helpful to learn:
 - how to split the large data,
 - familiar with exploratory data analysis(EDA) process, 
 - know how to use **seaborn**, **matplotlib plot** and **heatmap** for data visualization.
### Runing Environment
- Python 3 and above
- Jupyter Notebook
## Linear Regression Lab
In this lab we will work through the process of:
- implementing a univariate linear regression model
- defining, implementing and testing multiple loss functions
- minimizing loss functions using gradient descent
- comparing with python library functions
- Using the model to predict on new data
## Linear Algebra Basics Notebook
In this notebook, we will demonstrate some basic linear algebra functions using python libraries
### Set up
To read the image, you might need to install Python Imaging Library (PIL) for the environment, using
```
pip install pillow
```
